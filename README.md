## &lt;ancient&gt; Helper libraries for the .NET Framework &lt;/ancient&gt;


More an archive than a going concern at the moment, this very much "as is" collection of C# libraries might finally find some wider use. 
This collection, amassed over the years in order to help with dotnet development, may be useful when dealing with legacy systems where other upgrade scenarios are not preferable, or where a 'bitzer' toolbox is required for rapid but not necessarily enterprise development. 

Enjoy.
