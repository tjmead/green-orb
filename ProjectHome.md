This is a collection of libraries in C# which I've amassed over the years in order to help with dotnet development. Hopefully these (very much "as is") fragments can help someone else too.

Take, take, take! For years I've binged at the MIT open source all-you-can-eat buffet. But finally: GIVE!

Enjoy.
